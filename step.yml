  Shorebird Install
summary: |
  Installs the Shorebird CLI for use in the workflow. 
  Recommendation is to put this install step after Flutter is installed. 
  
  This step will attempt to configure Shorebird's Flutter version to match exisiting installed Flutter (if one is detected). 
  Shorebird does not support Flutter versions below 3.10.0.
